
This directory is intended for project header files.

Your credentials.h should go here and look approximately like this:
```
// credentials.h
#ifndef CREDENTIALS_H
#define CREDENTIALS_H

const char* ssid = "SSID_NAME";
const char* password = "WIFI_PASSWORD";

#endif // CREDENTIALS_H
```
